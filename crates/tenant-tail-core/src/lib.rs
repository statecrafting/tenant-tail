//! tenant-tail-core: the verify engines.
//!
//! Two cores, extracted standalone from OAP and kept in behavior parity with
//! their in-tree counterparts, relicensed Apache-2.0 from AGPL-3.0 by the sole
//! copyright holder (see NOTICE):
//!
//!   * certificate verify -- the producer-untrusted offline chain (Ed25519
//!     signature, certificate self-hash, stage artifact hashes, inter-stage
//!     manifest chain, optional platform countersign). The one spec-spine seam,
//!     `validate_spec_id_resolution`, is feature-gated OFF for this vended build
//!     (it is warn-only and changes no verdict; see `certificate`).
//!   * provenance verify -- the pure `validate()` plus the read-only `audit()`
//!     from OAP's standalone `provenance-validator`.
//!
//! The emitter is excluded by construction: no certificate builder, no signing
//! key handling, no identity. The cores are verify-only and offline.
