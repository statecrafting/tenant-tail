#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Git merge driver `tenant-tail-derived-regen` for the committed derived
# artifacts (spec-spine 0.5.0 shards them per-spec / per-package):
#   .derived/spec-registry/by-spec/*.json                 (compiler output)
#   .derived/codebase-index/by-spec/*.json, by-package/*.json (indexer output)
#
# Each shard carries a content hash, so two branches that each regenerated them
# conflict textually on the hash line. This driver resolves that conflict
# deterministically: it regenerates BOTH artifacts from the merged working tree
# (via the pinned spec-spine governing binary) and hands the fresh artifact named
# by %P back to git as the resolution.
#
# Enable in this clone (opt-in, one command):
#   ./.githooks/enable-merge-driver.sh
#
# Path assignment lives in committed .gitattributes:
#   .derived/**/*.json   merge=tenant-tail-derived-regen
#
# Git invokes:  <driver> %O %A %B %P
#   $1 = %O  ancestor version  (unused: both artifacts are fully derived)
#   $2 = %A  ours temp file     (the driver MUST leave the merged result here and exit 0)
#   $3 = %B  theirs version     (unused)
#   $4 = %P  pathname being merged
#
# Fail-closed: if no spec-spine governing binary is found or regeneration fails,
# exit 1 and leave the conflict in place. The CI staleness gate
# (`spec-spine index check`) remains the freshness source of truth; this driver
# is a convenience over the conflict, never a replacement for the gate.
#
# Mirror of spec-spine's `.githooks/merge-derived-index.sh`. tenant-tail dogfoods
# the exact-pinned repository-local spec-spine CLI, so the regen runs through
# `.bin/spec-spine` rather than a local spec-spine build.
